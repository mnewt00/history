            The Colosseum was used to host shows as well as a lot of other
            events. One of the shows was a show with people killing each over.
            This show was the last man standing wins so it was a fight to the
            death. One of these examples is one day, 1000 gladiators fought. 
	    The people who faught were called gladiators and they used
            weapons called gladius. It held over 50,000 poeple These shows were
            very religious, espacially for christians. Another show was the
            animal hunt. This used a lot of different animals, mainly from from
            Africa and the Middle East and including lepoards. It was very
            brutal and harsh but entertainment is an important part of the roman
            empire In 2011, it was offered some money for a restore of the
            colosseum.

          <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
            The work was delayed and it initially began in 2013. It finished
            restoration in late 2017. During the 16th and 17th century, Pope
            Sixtus V was planning to turn the colosseum to provide employment to
            unemployed citizens. This idea fell short as he died and it
            continued to be used for fighting.
          </p>
          <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
            Romans were very serious about their entertainment and there was
            anothing thing that was hosted at the colosseum which was chariot
            racing. It was a battle of a person on a vehicle pulled by a pack of
            horses, usually 2 or 4. Unfortuantly, animals were kept underneath
            the colosseum in cages including elephants, bears, buffaloes. These
            shows were believed to keep the citizen's happy and with their way
            of ruling.

          <p style="font-size: 1.25rem;">
            To many people today, Roman entertainment was cruel but on some
            days, there was poetry readings so it wasn't all violent
